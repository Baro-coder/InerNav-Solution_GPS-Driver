## **Description**

This project is a part of software created in order to develop the prototype for **Master Thesis** which I write to graduate at Military University of Technology in Warsaw, Poland.

The project contains software for AVR microcontroler **ATmega328P** as a driver for **Adafruit GPS Breakout v3** and *I2C slave device* for the main ARM microcontroller **STM32H743VIT6**.
